[branch]

  # Change the ordering of branches outputted from `git branch`. Sort in
  # descending order of last commit date.
  sort = -authordate:iso8601

[core]

  # Do not transform line endings to CRLF on Windows clients at checkout. This
  # is unnecessary since all modern code editors can be configured to support
  # Unix line endings (LF).
  autocrlf = false

  # Configure the default text editor that Git will use when it needs you to
  # edit a file or type an extended input message. If not configured, Git
  # uses your system's default editor. LazyGit will also read this setting and
  # use the configured editor for file editing operations. Reference:
  # https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config#ch_core_editor
  editor = vim --nofork

  # Normalize the line endings to the Unix standard (LF) on all files that Git
  # auto-detects as being text based. This is equivalent to adding the following
  # rule to `.gitattributes`:
  # ----
  # * text=auto eol=lf
  # ----
  eol = lf

  # Establish a global `.gitignore` file, which will be applied to all local
  # Git repositories but never be committed to any repository. Use this file to
  # include TODOs, scratch files or any other personal materials to the
  # working directories of local Git repositories without running the risk of
  # those files being committed to any repository.
  excludesFile = ~/local.gitignore

  # By default Git uses `less` to page output from commands like `git log` and
  # `git diff`. I prefer Delta: https://github.com/dandavison/delta
  pager = delta

[delta]

  # Custom configuration for the Delta pager.

  # This will need to be changed to true if the terminal uses a light theme.
  light = false

  # Show line numbers with diff output.
  line-numbers = true

  # Use `n` and `N` to move between diff sections.
  navigate = true

  # Show diffs in two vertical panels.
  # https://dandavison.github.io/delta/side-by-side-view.html
  side-by-side = true

[diff]

  # Color moved lines differently from changed lines. This is the same as adding
  # the `--color-moved` flag to `git diff`. Options are "no", "default",
  # "plain", "zebra" and "dimmed_zebra". https://git-scm.com/docs/diff-options
  colorMoved = default

  # Use vimdiff as diff tool.
  tool = vimdiff

[difftool]

  # Don't prompt to open the configured difftool, just open it.
  prompt = false

[fetch]

  # On `fetch` operations, automatically prune from the local repository any
  # references to branches and tags in the upstream repository that no longer
  # exist there.
  prune = true

[filter "lfs"]

  # Default configuration for Git LFS. This configuration is what gets added
  # automatically by the `git lfs install` command. https://git-lfs.com/
  process = git-lfs filter-process
  required = true
  clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
  smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f

[init]

  # Change the name of the default branch, which gets set when a new Git
  # repository is initialized the first time.
  defaultBranch = dev

[interactive]

  # When an interactive command such as `git add --patch` shows a colorized
  # diff, Git will pipe the diff through the shell command defined by this
  # configuration variable. The command may further markup the diff before
  # rendering. This is how we pipe the diff through the Delta pager. Delta's
  # `--color-only` flag disables Delta from structurally changing the diff,
  # which is required to maintain compatibility with Git.
  # https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config
  diffFilter = delta --color-only

[merge]

  # The `merge.conflictStyle` option specifies the style in which conflicted
  # hunks are written out in working tree files. The default option is "merge",
  # which prints `=======` to demarcate conflicting changes, which are
  # themselves ringfenced by `<<<<<<<` on one side and `>>>>>>>` on the other.
  # An alternate style, "diff3", adds a `|||||||` marker and the original text
  # before the `=======` marker. This is not recommended since not all
  # mainstream merge tools understand this syntax.
  # https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-config
  # conflictStyle = diff3

  # By default, Git does not create an explicit merge commit if merging a
  # commit that is a descendant of the current HEAD commit. Instead, the tip
  # of the current branch is simply fast-forwarded to the commit being merged.
  # Otherwise an explicit merge commit is created to resolve the divergent work
  # between the source and target branches. This is equivalent to using the
  # `--ff` flag or setting `merge.ff` to `true` â€“ but it's easier to think of
  # this as "auto" mode, it means "fast-forward if possible".
  #
  # Whe `merge.ff` is set to `false` or the `--no-ff` flag is used, an explicit
  # merge commit will be recorded every time, even if a simple fast-forward
  # operation is possible. This option can't be used with `--squash` for reasons
  # that are well explained here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14322024
  #
  # Finally, `merge.ff` can be set to `"only"`, which is the equivalent of
  # using the `--ff-only` flag. With this setting, Git will refuse to handle
  # merges that cannot be simply fast-forwarded. This means, where there is
  # divergent work in the source branch, the target branch must first be rebased
  # on the source branch before the merge operation will succeed.
  #
  # Squash (`--squash`) and fast-forwarding (`--ff-only`) are the two merge
  # strategies that achieve linear commit histories. It is possible to use
  # the two options together (`--squash --ff-only`). In this case, if the source
  # branch has diverged from the target branch (so a fast-forward is not
  # possible) then the merge is rejected. Otherwise, rather than fast-forwarding,
  # all the extra commits on the target branch are squashed onto the source
  # branch, creating a new commit there.
  #
  # The following resource provides a good summary of theseGit merge strategies:
  # https://bit.ly/3ZZ2xOi
  #
  # My preference is to use `git merge` to perform true merges, ie creating
  # explicit merge commits even when not needed to resolve conflicts, and to
  # use aliases such as `git squash` and `git fast-forward` to apply other
  # integration strategies.
  ff = false

  # Set the default for `git mergetool --tool=[tool]`. For vimdiff, the following
  # values are supported:
  # - vimdiff:  use Vim with a custom layout as specified using separate hints
  # - vimdiff1: use Vim with a 2 panes layout: LOCAL and REMOTE
  # - vimdiff2: use Vim with a 3 panes layout: LOCAL, MERGED and REMOTE
  # - vimdiff3: use Vim where only the MERGED file is shown
  tool = vimdiff2

[mergetool]

  # Prevent generation of `.orig` files, which can all-too-easily get committed
  # to source control by accident.
  keepBackup = false

  # Don't prompt to open the configured mergetool.
  prompt = false

[pull]

  # On `git pull` operations, always rebase the current branch on top of the
  # upstream branch after fetching. This helps to maintain a clean, linear
  # commit history.
  rebase = true

[push]

  # Push tags with commits by default. Equivalent to the `--follow-tags` option.
  followTags = true

  # By default, push branches to branches of the same name in the upstream repo.
  # It means you can `git push` excluding the `<remote> <branch>` parameters.
  default = current

  # Automatically set up branch tracking. This is equivalent to using
  # `--set-upstream` | `-u` on `git push`. This option must be used in
  # conjunction with an appropriate `default` option, eg `default = current`.
  # This option is available since Git 2.37.
  autoSetupRemote = true

[rebase]

  # Add the `--autosquash` option to every `rebase` operation by default. This
  # will automatically handle commit messages that are prefixed "squash!",
  # "fixup!" or "amend!", changing the rebase action from "pick" to "squash",
  # "fixup" and "fixup -C" respectively. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/66833278
  #
  # (Note: "fixup -C" is the same as "fixup" except the log message of the
  # "fixup!" commit replaces the message of the target commit, rather than the
  # other way around.)
  #
  # This is a better default because interactive rebase still gives us the
  # chance to edit the actions per commit, before the rebase operation proper.
  # And this default behavior can still be disabled on a case-by-case basis by
  # adding the `--no-autosquash` option to the `git rebase` command.
  autosquash = true

[safe]

  # If your Git repositories are on an external drive, Git will consider them
  # to be owned by someone else and therefore unsafe by default. This setting
  # completely opts-out of this security check.
  # https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory
  directory = *

[include]

  # Allow extensions to this base Git configuration via `~/local.gitconfig`.
  # Note, the `include.path` config MUST be maintained at the bottom of the
  # `.gitconfig` template, as the contents of the included path are injected
  # at this position and we want the included file to have the opportunity to
  # override anything in the `.gitconfig` template.
  path = ~/local.gitconfig
