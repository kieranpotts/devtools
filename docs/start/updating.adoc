= Updating

It is easy to update your system to use the latest dotfiles configuration from this repository. There's a script for that! Sync your local instance of the devtools repository then, from the local repository's root directory, run:

[source,sh]
----
sh bin/posix/update!
----

Or, if you have added this repository's `bin/posix` directory to your system PATH, then you can just type:

[source,sh]
----
update!
----

This script reinstall dotfiles and related symlinks. This is only for the Unix dotfiles. Symlinks for program configurations need to be maintained manually.
