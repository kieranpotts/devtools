= Git aliases

50+ Git aliases are included. These extend Git's built-in operations, providing shortcuts for common Git workflows.

All the Git aliases are implemented as shell scripts in the `bin` directory. For the aliases to work, thw `bin` directory MUST be added to your system path. Then, to see what aliases are available, run the command `git aliases` – itself an alias! – in your terminal.

WARNING: Some of the operations enabled via the Git aliases are potentially destructive. For example, some Git aliases rewrite commit histories.
